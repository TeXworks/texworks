# TeXworks: Patterns for syntax coloring

# Each entry consists of three whitespace-separated fields:
# <style> <spell?> <regex>

# <style> is a combination of color and style flags
# Valid syntax:
# <fgcolor>
# <fgcolor>/<bgcolor>
# ;<fontflags>
# <fgcolor>;<fontflags>
# <fgcolor>/<bgcolor>;<fontflags>
#
# The color fields <fgcolor> and <bgcolor> are either:
# *) a color name from the list defined in the SVG standard;
#    see http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/types.html#ColorKeywords
# *) a hexadecimal color value of the form #rrggbb; note that if this is used at
#    the beginning of a line, a space " " must be added in front of it so the
#    line is not interpreted as a comment (e.g., " #aabbcc" instead of "#aabbcc")
#
# The <fontflags> field is a combination of the letters
# B (bold)
# I (italic)
# U (underlined)

# <spell> is a flag controlling whether this style is subject to spell-checking;
# "Y" or "y" for yes, "N" (or anything else, actually) for no.

# <regex> is the regular expression to match.

# Note that order of rules may be important if several rules could match at the same position;
# this is why the generic "control sequence" rule comes AFTER the specific \begin/\end one.
