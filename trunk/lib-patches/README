texworks lib-patches directory
==============================

The Windows and Mac OS X builds of texworks are created using a slightly patched
version of some libraries, to fix some bugs or provide some additional features
(such as added support for platform fonts).



Poppler patches (poppler-*.patch)
---------------------------------
The Windows and Mac OS X builds of texworks are created using a slightly patched
version of poppler, to provide some added support for platform fonts (on OS X,
and when building with mingw32 on Windows) and to allow the use of a "local"
poppler-data directory as we cannot expect a system-wide poppler installation on
these platforms.

This directory contains the relevant patches, as used with poppler-0.12 for the
TeXworks 0.2 release.



Qt patches (qt-*.patch)
-----------------------
 * qt-4_7_2-qpathclipper.patch
   Qt 4.7.0 and 4.7.1 contain a bug causing TeXworks to crash under certain
   circumstances (http://bugreports.qt.nokia.com/browse/QTBUG-15823).
   This patch fixes the problem. Note that for Qt 4.7.2 and higher, this bug
   should be fixed upstream.
