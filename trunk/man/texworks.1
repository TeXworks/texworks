\- a simple TeX front-end program

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B texworks
[FILE]...

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B TeXworks
is an environment for authoring TeX (LaTeX, ConTeXt, etc) documents, with a Unicode-based, TeX-aware editor, integrated PDF viewer, and a clean, simple interface accessible to casual and non-technical users.

It is inspired by Dick Koch's award-winning TeXShop program for Mac OS X, which has made quality typesetting through TeX accessible to a wider community of users, without a technical or intimidating face. The goal of
.B TeXworks
is to deliver a similarly integrated, easy-to-use environment for users on other platforms, especially GNU/Linux and Windows.
