TODO (required fixes/features/enhancements):
 - GotoPage should not center on page
 - zoom/hand tools
 - ctrl+mousewheel should zoom
 - maquee zoom (requested by Philip Taylor)
 - context menu
 - Flesh out link support
 - Add some loading indicators so that users know something is happening in the background when pages are blank or blurry
 - scrolling beyond edge at single page mode (mouse wheel/up/down)
 - round magnifying glass
 - magnifying glass size
 - Sync signal
 - sync/goto slot
 - fit to width/page/...
 - Highlighting! (to show syncing destination, search results, etc.)
 - PgDn should scroll one viewport height
 - draw frame around magnifying glass (requested by Reinhard Kotucha)
 - make the magnifying glass a top-level window (so it can extend outside the main view's window boundaries) (requested by Reinhard Kotucha)
 - _Comment on how `pageScale` works and is used._
 - Check memory usage

WISHLIST:
 - annotations (popup window)
 - rulers (in main window, and attached to magnifying glass)
 - possibility to abort render requests when page moves out of view (is there a
   way to avoid going through all pages at each scroll event?)
 - Split view???
 - Improve handling of several concurrent versions (magnifications) of the same
   page (currently: "normal" and "magnified" versions); simplify code, remove
   redundancy, etc.
