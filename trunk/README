Building TeXworks
=================

Notes by Jonathan Kew, updated 2009-10-02

To build TeXworks from source, you will need to install developer packages (or equivalent) for:

 - Qt4 (4.5.2 is recommended, although the application may build with versions as old as 4.3.x. Note that on GNU/Linux, TeXworks may crash when changing the spell-checking language when using Qt 4.3.x. Updating to at least Qt 4.4.0 solves this.)
   http://qt.nokia.com/downloads

 - Poppler (using the latest stable release, currently 0.12, is strongly recommended, although versions as old as the 0.6 series should still work)
   http://poppler.freedesktop.org/

 - Hunspell (release 1.2.8 is recommended; earlier 1.2.x releases may be used, although support for some non-Latin-script languages may be lacking)
   http://hunspell.sourceforge.net/

 - libdbus (on X11-based platforms only; not used on Mac OS X or Windows)
   http://dbus.freedesktop.org/

along with their dependencies (such as Freetype, fontconfig, zlib, etc.) Details will depend on your platform. On Linux or similar systems, your package manager can probably provide all these.

After installing the necessary libraries (and their headers), check the TeXworks.pro file and update paths as necessary; some of the paths currently in the project file are specific to one of my build machines.

Once the project file is correct, run qmake to create a Makefile or Xcode project, and then run make or use Xcode to build the application. Do not run "qmake -pro" to recreate the .pro file, as it has been hand-edited.

The current TeXworks prototype has been successfully built with
 - Xcode (using gcc 4) on Mac OS X (built on 10.5, but should run on 10.4 or later)
 - MinGW release 5.1.4 on Windows XP (also runs on Vista and Windows 7)
 - gcc 4 on GNU/Linux, various BSDs, etc.
Getting all the right libraries built and installed for the mingw32 build can be tricky. By slightly patching poppler 0.8.0, it is possible to build a version that does not depend on fontconfig (and thence on various other libraries), though it will then not work properly for PDFs with non-embedded fonts.

To avoid having to build the poppler dependencies for Windows, you can get precompiled libraries from the KDE on Windows project.

Further tips on building TeXworks from source are available on some of the wiki pages.
