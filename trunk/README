Building TeXworks
=================

Notes by Jonathan Kew, 2008-04-21

To build TeXworks from source, you will need to install developer packages for Qt4 (4.3.2 is known to work; later versions should also work) and Poppler (0.8.0 or later), along with their dependencies (such as Freetype, fontconfig, zlib, etc.) Details will depend on your platform.

After installing the necessary libraries (and their headers), check the TeXworks.pro file and update paths as necessary; some of the paths currently in the project file are specific to one of my build machines.

Once the project file is correct, run qmake to create a Makefile or Xcode project, and then run make or use Xcode to build the application. Do not run "qmake -pro" to recreate the .pro file, as it has been hand-edited.

The current TeXworks prototype has been successfully built with
 - Xcode 2.2 on Mac OS X 10.4
 - gcc 4 on Linux
 - mingw32 on Windows XP
 - mingw32 cross-compiler hosted on Mac OS X
Getting all the right libraries built and installed for the mingw32 can be tricky. By slightly patching poppler 0.8.0, it is possible to build a version that does not depend on fontconfig (and thence on various other libraries), though it will then not work properly for PDFs with non-embedded fonts.

To avoid having to build the poppler dependencies for Windows, you can get precompiled libraries from the KDE on Windows project.

Alternatively, I believe a Visual C build would have fewer dependencies, as poppler builds differently under VC (that's another story...), but I have not tried this personally.
