      TeXworks is an environment for authoring TeX (LaTeX, ConTeXt, etc) documents, with a
      Unicode-based, TeX-aware editor, integrated PDF viewer, and a clean, simple
      interface accessible to casual and non-technical users.
    </p>
    <p>
      TeXworks is inspired by Dick Koch's award-winning TeXShop program for Mac OS X,
      which has made quality typesetting through TeX accessible to a wider community
      of users, without a technical or intimidating face. The goal of TeXworks is to
      deliver a similarly integrated, easy-to-use environment for users on other
      platforms, especially GNU/Linux and Windows.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among other things, TeXworks features an integrated PDF previewer, synchronization
      between the TeX files and the PDF output, and an extensible scripting interface.
