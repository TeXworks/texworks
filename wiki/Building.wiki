#summary Notes on building TeXworks on various distributions.

Building !TeXworks on typical GNU/Linux systems should be fairly straightforward. You just need standard build tools (gcc, make, etc.), and the development files (not just runtime libraries) for Qt4, poppler, hunspell, and dbus. The exact set of packages needed will depend how your distribution arranges things; some examples are given here.

For Windows users wanting to try a build, see the page about installing and [BuildingOnWindowsMinGW using the MinGW tools on WinXP]. There is also a page about [BuildingOnWindows using Visual C++ 2005], although this compiler is no longer being distributed. Thanks to Stefan LÃ¶ffler, Alain Delmotte, and Tomek for researching and documenting these Windows build procedures.

=== Fedora 9 ===

{{{
# yum install poppler-devel qt4-devel hunspell-devel
$ svn checkout http://texworks.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ texworks-read-only
$ cd texworks-read-only
$ qmake
$ make
$ ./texworks
}}}

(Thanks to Dave Crossland for this.)

=== Fedora 10 ===

{{{
$ sudo yum groupinstall x-software-development development-tools
$ sudo yum install subversion poppler-devel poppler-qt4-devel qt-devel hunspell-devel dbus-devel
$ svn checkout http://texworks.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ texworks-read-only
$ cd texworks-read-only
$ qmake-qt4
$ make
$ ./texworks
}}}

(Thanks to Dave Crossland for this.)

=== Ubuntu (Hardy) & Debian ===

{{{
$ sudo aptitude install build-essential libpoppler-qt4-dev libhunspell-dev libdbus-1-dev
$ svn checkout http://texworks.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ texworks-read-only
$ cd texworks-read-only
$ qmake-qt4
$ make
$ ./texworks
}}}

(I hope this is OK; have not checked on a completely virgin Ubuntu system, so it is possible I missed something in the dependencies.)


Another option would be to use the [http://tug.org/pipermail/texworks/2008q3/000002.html Ubuntu package] announced by Martin Sievers, thus avoiding the need to compile from source.

=== OpenSUSE 11.1 ===

Reported by [http://code.google.com/u/msiniscalchi/ msiniscalchi]:

Under OpenSUSE 11.1, I had to install the following devel packages:

{{{
gcc
make
hunspell-devel
poppler-devel
libqt4-devel
libpoppler-qt4-devel
}}}

Issuing `qmake TeXworks.pro` and then `make` left me with a working binary.
