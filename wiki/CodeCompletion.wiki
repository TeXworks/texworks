=Using code completion=

!TeXworks comes with an expandable set of code templates that can easily be inserted into a (La)TeX document. To insert a code template, type the first few characters of the pattern name and press `<Tab>`. The code template best matching the characters you typed will be inserted and highlighted. If there are multiple code templates starting with the characters you typed press `<Tab>` to cycle through the possibilities.

Some code templates include bullet characters •. These act as placeholders where text should be inserted. Use `<Ctrl>+<Tab>` and `<Shift>+<Ctrl>+<Tab>` (`<Alt>+<Tab>` and `<Alt>+<Shift>+<Tab>` on Mac) to navigate between those placeholders.

Some of the most common code templates are listed below:

|| --   ||  \textendash ||
|| ---  ||  \textemdash ||
|| lbl  ||  \label{} ||
|| ref  ||  \ref{} ||
|| sec  ||  \section{} ||
|| ssec ||  \subsection{} ||
|| bf   ||  \textbf{} ||
|| em   ||  \emph{} ||
|| xa   ||  \alpha ||
|| xb   ||  \beta ||
|| _...etc..._  ||  

=Customizing code completion=

The code completion templates are located in the `completion` sub-directory of your [TipsAndTricks#Locating_and_customizing_TeXworks_resources TeXworks resource directory].

The general syntax of a code completion template is the following:
{{{
	<alias>:=<text>
}}}
The `<alias>:=` part can be omitted to turn the code text into its own alias. `<text>` must fit in a single line (see below for ways to produce a multi-line code template). Empty lines and lines starting with a `%` are ignored.

In `<text>` several special markers are allowed:

|| `#RET#` || is replaced by a line break upon expansion of the template ||
|| `#INS#` || upon expansion the cursor is placed at this position. Any additional #INS# markers are ignored ||
|| `•`     || the Unicode character U+2022 (BULLET) is used as a placeholder where text should be entered; navigate through to the placeholders with `<Ctrl>+<Tab>` and `<Shift>+<Ctrl>+<Tab>` (`<Alt>+<Tab>` and `<Alt>+<Shift>+<Tab>` on Mac) ||

Please refer to the existing code completion template files for numerous examples.
