texworks poppler-patches directory
==================================

The Windows and Mac OS X builds of texworks are created using a slightly patched
version of poppler, to provide some added support for platform fonts (on OS X,
and when building with mingw32 on Windows) and to allow the use of a "local"
poppler-data directory as we cannot expect a system-wide poppler installation on
these platforms.

This directory contains the relevant patches, as used with poppler-0.12 for the
TeXworks 0.2 release.
