This directory contains a subset of the URW PostScript fonts required by PDF
viewers.

These are the fonts published by URW and now maintained on CTAN, not the
modified fonts shipped with Ghostscript.

For the rest of the URW PostScript fonts and some additional information, see
http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/fonts/urw/base35

The files were renamed from the "Karl-Berry scheme" to the original URW scheme
expected by the poppler library. For a list of font name mappings, see
http://www.tug.org/fontname/html/URW-fonts.html
