TeXworks win32/ directory
=========================

This directory contains files and folders that are useful and/or necessary only
on Windows.

texworks-setup-script.iss
   Inno-Setup script to build an installer; run from the TeXworks top directory

extra-setup-languages/
   Additional, third-party translations needed for building the installer

fonts/
   Windows by default does not provide (subsitutes for) all base 14 fonts that
   every PDF viewer must support. The fonts/ directory contains the rest of the
   type1 fonts. Copy this folder into the installation directory (i.e., the one
   that contains TeXworks.exe)
