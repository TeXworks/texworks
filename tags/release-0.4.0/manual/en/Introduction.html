<h1><a id="x4-20001" name="x4-20001"></a>Introduction</h1>
<!--l. 7-->

<p class="indent">Donald E. Knuth<a id="dx4-2001" name=
"dx4-2001"></a> decided to create a new typesetting system, which
would be called T<sub>E</sub>X<a id="dx4-2002" name=
"dx4-2002"></a>, because there had been a change in the printing
system used for the volumes of his book <em>The Art of Computer
Programming</em> and Knuth found the result of the new system
awful. <!--l. 9--></p>

<p class="indent">The goal of T<sub>E</sub>X was then to have a
system which would always produce the same documents independently
of the actual machine they were processed on. Knuth also designed
the <em>Computer Modern</em> family of typefaces and the
<span class="sansserif">METAFONT</span><a id="dx4-2003" name=
"dx4-2003"></a> language for font description. <!--l. 11--></p>

<p class="indent">The work initiated in 1977 was finished (the
languages were “frozen”) in 1989. T<sub>E</sub>X and <span class=
"sansserif">METAFONT</span> are not evolving any more except for
minor bug fixes (T<sub>E</sub>X versions are numbered following the
decimals of <span class="lmmi-12">π</span>—now 3.1415926—and
<span class="sansserif">METAFONT</span> the decimals of the number
“e”—now 2.718281). <!--l. 13--></p>

<p class="indent">T<sub>E</sub>X provides basic tools
(commands/instructions/“primitives”) to define typesetting; almost
every detail has to be defined, but the language allows the
creation of macros for repeatedly used constructs. So collections
of macros are loaded through format files<a id="dx4-2004" name=
"dx4-2004"></a> (i.e., pre-compiled large macro collections). 
<!--l. 15--></p>

<p class="indent">Knuth created an original default format (more or
less 600 commands) which is called <em>Plain T<sub>E</sub>X<a id=
"dx4-2005" name="dx4-2005"></a></em>. This facilitates creating
documents. <!--l. 17--></p>

<p class="indent">The most widely used format is
L<sup>A</sup>T<sub>E</sub>X<a id="dx4-2006" name="dx4-2006"></a>
(Leslie Lamport<a id="dx4-2007" name="dx4-2007"></a>, 1985), which
provides more global commands and structures for documents
(article, book,…) allowing easier and faster work, but sometimes
with loss of flexibility due to the more or less rigid framework.
But there are many other formats and T<sub>E</sub>X-variants in use
as well, such as <span class="cmsy-10x-x-120"><img src=
"images/cmsy10-c-41.png" alt="A" class=
"10-120x-x-41" /></span><span class="cmsy-10x-x-120"><img src=
"images/cmsy10-c-4d.png" alt="M" class="10-120x-x-4d" /></span>
<span class="cmsy-10x-x-120"><img src="images/cmsy10-c-53.png" alt=
"S" class="10-120x-x-53" /></span>-T<sub>E</sub>X<a id="dx4-2008"
name="dx4-2008"></a>, <span class="cmsy-10x-x-120"><img src=
"images/cmsy10-c-41.png" alt="A" class=
"10-120x-x-41" /></span><span class="cmsy-10x-x-120"><img src=
"images/cmsy10-c-4d.png" alt="M" class="10-120x-x-4d" /></span>
<span class="cmsy-10x-x-120"><img src="images/cmsy10-c-53.png" alt=
"S" class="10-120x-x-53" /></span>-L<sup>A</sup>T<sub>E</sub>X,
ConT<sub>E</sub>Xt<a id="dx4-2009" name="dx4-2009"></a>, or
X<sub>E</sub>T<sub>E</sub>X, each having specific goals and
advantages (and drawbacks). <!--l. 19--></p>

<p class="indent">To extend the format, one loads “packages<a id=
"dx4-2010" name="dx4-2010"></a>” which are collections of macros
specific to some aspect of typesetting. <!--l. 21--></p>

<p class="indent">From its specification in the late 1970s, the
T<sub>E</sub>X family had to evolve until now, last version March
2008, to take into account the developments in the typesetting
world outside T<sub>E</sub>X. <!--l. 23--></p>

<p class="indent">Some of the problems to answer were/are:</p>

<ul class="itemize1">
<li class="itemize">taking into account other languages with
“alphabets” larger than the ASCII<span class=
"footnote-mark"><a href="index5.html#fn1x2"><sup class=
"textsuperscript">1</sup></a></span><a id="x4-2011f1" name=
"x4-2011f1"></a> one or with non-Latin characters altogether,</li>

<li class="itemize">having more fonts, there is not much variety in
the fonts created with <span class="sansserif">METAFONT</span> (few
font creators use it),</li>

<li class="itemize">creating documents in other formats than the
normal DVI<span class="footnote-mark"><a href=
"index6.html#fn2x2"><sup class=
"textsuperscript">2</sup></a></span><a id="x4-2012f2" name=
"x4-2012f2"></a>,</li>

<li class="itemize">using the rich possibilities of other
typesetting systems and formats like PostScript and PDF,</li>

<li class="itemize">having more calculation and scripting
facilities,…</li>
</ul><!--l. 32-->

<p class="indent">To answer these questions and others, many
“engines” and programmes have been created around T<sub>E</sub>X,
including pdftex<a id="dx4-2013" name="dx4-2013"></a>, pdflatex,
dvips<a id="dx4-2014" name="dx4-2014"></a>, ps2pdf, and
<span class="sansserif">METAPOST</span><a id="dx4-2015" name=
"dx4-2015"></a>, which opens the T<sub>E</sub>X world to the
possibilities of PostScript<a id="dx4-2016" name="dx4-2016"></a>
and PDF<a id="dx4-2017" name="dx4-2017"></a>.
X<sub>E</sub>T<sub>E</sub>X<a id="dx4-2018" name="dx4-2018"></a>
and X<sub>E</sub>L<sup>A</sup>T<sub>E</sub>Xto be able to use the
“normal” fonts found on the different machines and to be able to
cope with writing systems different from the left to right systems
which originated in Europe (Latin and Cyrillic letters and
associates)—right to left, vertically, pictograms,…Or LuaTeX<a id=
"dx4-2019" name="dx4-2019"></a> and LuaLaTeX to have a powerful
scripting language. <!--l. 34--></p>

<p class="indent">To use T<sub>E</sub>X and the systems of its
family, one has to create a “source” document<a id="dx4-2020" name=
"dx4-2020"></a> as T<sub>E</sub>X is only a system to “transform” a
source document into a (beautifully) typeset document. This source
is a simple text with typesetting instructions and one needs a
programme to create it: the editor<a id="dx4-2021" name=
"dx4-2021"></a>. <!--l. 36--></p>

<p class="indent">There are many editors able to create a
T<sub>E</sub>X source; some are general editors, others are
specifically designed for T<sub>E</sub>X: here
T<sub>E</sub>Xworks<a id="dx4-2022" name="dx4-2022"></a> comes in. 
<!--l. 39--></p>

<p class="indent"><b>T<sub>E</sub>Xworks</b> is a project to create
a text editor for use with the T<sub>E</sub>X family of tools; we
will refer to these as (L<sup>A</sup>)T<sub>E</sub>X. Instead of
creating a new sophisticated program, equipped with multiple
tool-bars to meet any need, T<sub>E</sub>Xworks provides a simple
editor, offering at first sight only a limited set of tools for
text editing as well as a single button and a menu to typeset a
(L<sup>A</sup>)T<sub>E</sub>X text. <!--l. 41--></p>

<p class="indent">The idea to create the editor came to
<em>Jonathan Kew<a id="dx4-2023" name="dx4-2023"></a></em>, the
initiator and leader of the project, after a long period of
reflection on the reasons why potential users tend to keep away
from (L<sup>A</sup>)T<sub>E</sub>X, as well as pondering the
success of the <b>T<sub>E</sub>Xshop<a id="dx4-2024" name=
"dx4-2024"></a></b> editor on the Mac. <!--l. 43--></p>

<p class="indent">Finally the goal was also to provide the same
editor on many operating systems: T<sub>E</sub>Xworks currently
runs on Linux, Mac OS X and Windows. The interface is always the
same and the program offers the same functionality on all three
platforms. <!--l. 45--></p>

<p class="indent">After this introduction, the second section of
this manual explains how to install the software. In the third
section, we describe the interface and create a first document
showing the basics of T<sub>E</sub>Xworks. In the forth and fifth
section, the advanced tools provided by T<sub>E</sub>Xworks are
presented; you should read these sections only after mastering the
basic working of T<sub>E</sub>Xworks. These advanced tools allow
much more effective working practices. The sixth section gives a
brief introduction to scripting. This section focuses on using
ready-made scripts, not on writing your own scripts (which is
beyond the scope of this manual and will be presented elsewhere).
After that, the seventh section in which some pointers to further
information about T<sub>E</sub>Xworks and sources for help are
compiled concludes the main part. <!--l. 47--></p>

<p class="indent">Finally, the appendices provide additional
information how T<sub>E</sub>Xworks can be customized, about the
regular expression search/replace system, and how
T<sub>E</sub>Xworks can be compiled from source. A short
bibliography and an index conclude this manual.</p>

"x4-30001.1" name="x4-30001.1"></a>Icons and style</h3><!--l. 51-->

<p class="noindent">Because a picture is often worth a thousand
words, icons and special styling is used throughout this manual to
avoid cumbersome paraphrases or mark specialties. Keyboard keys are
usually depicted as &nbsp; <span class="ec-lmss-10">A</span>
&nbsp;, with the exception of a few special keys. These are:
<span class="keystroke">Shift <span class=
"lmsy-10x-x-120">⇑</span></span>, <span class="keystroke">Page

<p class="indent">In addition, mouse clicks are depicted as
<img src="images/LMB.png" alt="pict" /> (left click) and <img src=
"images/RMB.png" alt="pict" /> (right click; on Mac OS X with a
one-button mouse, this is usually available by holding down
<span class="keystroke">Ctrl</span> while clicking). 
<!--l. 56--></p>

<p class="indent">Apart from input instructions, several passages
throughout this manual are marked by special styling. 
<!--l. 59--></p>

<p class="indent">Information that is only valid or relevant for a
particular operating system is marked like this:</p>

<div class="OSspecific">
<div class="OSspecificLogo OSWindows"></div>This only concerns you
if you use Windows.<br class="newline" />
Of course you can also read it if you use another operating
system.<br class="newline" />
It just will not be of much use to you.
