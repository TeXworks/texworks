TeXworks testcases directory
============================

This directory contains testcases that can be used to check certain
functionalities of the program.


base14-fonts.pdf / base14-fonts.png
   This file checks that the standard PDF fonts (base 14 fonts) are rendered
   correctly even if not embedded (every PDF viewer must support this).
   To test, simply open base14-fonts.pdf and compare the render output with
   base14-fonts.png

poppler-data.pdf / poppler-data.png
   This file checks that poppler-data is picked up correctly. This is needed to
   correctly display certain CJK documents
   To test, simply open poppler-data.pdf and compare the render output with
   poppler-data.png
   
   Disclaimer: This file is provided as-is for the sole purpose of testing CJK
