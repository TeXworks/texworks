TeXworks translations directory trans/
======================================

This directory contains translations of the TeXworks user interface to several
languages.

Here is some additional information regarding the files in this directory:

 * All TeXworks_*.ts files were contributed by the TeXworks community. They are
   the source files for the translations. They are XML files, but can be edited
   most conveniently by using Qt's "linguist" tool. Contact information about
   the individual contributers can be found in the "TWApp" context under the
   "[translator's name/email]" key. On a *nix like shell with the grep tool
   available, you can also use
      grep -A 1 '\[translator&apos;s name/email\]' *.ts

 * All qt/qt_*.ts files are translation source files for Qt UI elements (such as
   standard dialogs). Unless noted otherwise, they were taken from the Qt
   source repository.

 * All *.qm files are the binary representations of the corresponding .ts files
   generated by the Qt tool "lrelease".



Qt language files that were taken from the VirtualBox repository
