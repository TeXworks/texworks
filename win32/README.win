Introduction
================================================================================

TeXworks is an environment for authoring TeX (LaTeX, ConTeXt, etc) documents,
with a Unicode-based, TeX-aware editor, integrated PDF viewer, and a clean,
simple interface accessible to casual and non-technical users.

TeXworks is inspired by Dick Koch's award-winning TeXShop program for Mac OS X,
which has made quality typesetting through TeX accessible to a wider community
of users, without a technical or intimidating face. The goal of TeXworks is to
deliver a similarly integrated, easy-to-use environment for users on other
platforms, especially GNU/Linux and Windows.



Installation
================================================================================

Just extract the contents of the Zip file wherever you want and then run the
extracted TeXworks.exe.
