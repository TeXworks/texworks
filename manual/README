Introduction
================================================================================

This package contains the sources to typeset "A short manual for TeXworks".

TeXworks is an open-source, cross-platform TeX editor designed to lower the
entry barrier to the TeX world. See http://www.tug.org/texworks/ for more
information.

The actual sources for the document (together with further information,
licensing details, etc.) are located in the src/<lang>/ folders to allow the
manual to be translated.



Typesetting
================================================================================

Assuming you have a GNU make compatible version of make installed, you can run
  make
(or alternatively the name of your version, e.g., mingw32-make) in this
directory form the command line to build all pdf and html versions of the
manual. Please note that this requires pdflatex & friends to be in your $PATH.
For typesetting the html version, you additionally need ghostscript and the
ImageMagick convert tools in your path. In addition, tidy is recommended.

Note that not all parts of the makefiles are platform-independent and tested on
other than GNU/Linux systems and may thus fail on your system. In the case your
invocation doesn't produce a valid output, you can typeset the manual by
manually running the proper commands, of course.
