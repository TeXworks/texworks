Introduction
================================================================================

This package contains the sources to typeset "Petit manuel pour TeXworks", the
french translation of "A short manual for TeXworks" contributed by Alain

entry barrier to the TeX world. See http://www.tug.org/texworks/ for more
information.




Typesetting
================================================================================

To typeset this document, you need LaTeX. This is usually provided by a TeX
distribution such as:
 * TeXLive (http://www.tug.org/texlive/)
 * MiKTeX (http://www.miktex.org/)
 * MacTeX (http://www.tug.org/mactex/)

Make sure you have the following required LaTeX packages installed:
	amsmath, amssymb, array, babel, booktabs, calc, color, fancyhdr, fancyvrb,
	fncychap, fontenc, footmisc, framed, graphicx, hyperref, idxlayout,
	inputenc, keystroke, lmodern, longtable, makeidx, microtype, needspace,
	sectsty, tocbibind, upquote, url, wrapfig,
and the ZapfChancery font.

When using TeXLive, these can be installed by running
	tlmgr install amsfonts amsmath babel booktabs fancyhdr fancyvrb fncychap \
	              footmisc framed graphics hyperref idxlayout keystroke latex \
	              lm microtype needspace sectsty tocbibind tools upquote url \
	              wrapfig zapfchan
from the command line.

If you intend to typeset in the HTML format, you also need tex4ht.
