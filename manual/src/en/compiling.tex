\chapter{Compiling {\Tw}}\index{compiling {\Tw}}
\label{sec.compiling}

A complete guide how to compile {\Tw} is far beyond the scope of this manual. However, most users should find precompiled versions suitable for their system come either with their {\TeX} distribution or their operating system. If this is not the case, several precompiled versions can also be downloaded from \url{http://code.google.com/p/texworks/downloads/list}.

Compiling {\Tw} yourself is only necessary if your system is not (yet) supported, if you want to always have the latest features (and bugs), or generally want to help in improving {\Tw} further. To this end, there are some documents giving detailed instructions to compile {\Tw} on different machines.
